Learning spark one brick at a time

Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Read CSV").getOrCreate()

# Read CSV file into a DataFrame
df = spark.read.csv('/content/sample_data/california_housing_test.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Show the DataFrame schema
df.printSchema()

# Show the first few rows of the DataFrame
df.show()"
